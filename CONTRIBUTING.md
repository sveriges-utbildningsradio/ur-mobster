# Introduction

## Glad you're interested in contributing to UR Mob! ðŸ˜€

First off, thank you for considering contributing to UR Mob. It's people like you that make UR Mob such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

UR Mob is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, including improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into UR Mob itself.

## Before you get started

### Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Responsibilities

- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. Again, read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) if unsure.

### Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to UR Mob? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

- [Good first issues](https://github.com/sveriges-utbildningsradio/ur-mobster/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/sveriges-utbildningsradio/ur-mobster/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

# How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email [David Lowe Larsson](david.lowelarsson@ur.se) instead.

Any security issues should be submitted directly to [David Lowe Larsson](david.lowelarsson@ur.se).

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

- Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
- Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at [david.lowelarsson@ur.se](david.lowelarsson@ur.se).

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in UR Mob, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that UR Mob has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code, commit message and labeling conventions

We strive to write [semantic commit messages](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages).

Check out the [.eslintrc](.eslintrc) with code conventions coming from [ERB](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate), extending several popular configurations including [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Run `yarn lint` to lint.

UR Mob strives to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We release patch versions for critical bugfixes, minor versions for new features or non-essential changes, and major versions for any breaking changes.

Submit all changes directly to the `master` branch. We don't use separate branches for development or for upcoming releases. We do our best to keep master in good shape, with all tests passing.
